React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. But why should we even use **React**?

There might be many reasons for which people prefer to use React, I would like to add two more to the list of those reasons :D

- It helps you write more "declarative" (cleaner) code

  - Declarative code tells **"what"** to do (the “how” is taken care of at the backend by the library itself). Example: React JS
  - Imperative code tells you **"how"** to do things instead of leaving everything to the backend libraries, which means you ultimately have to write more code to explain everything by yourself. Example: Vanilla JS

- It is composable

  - It allows us to make loosely coupled components and put them together to use, instead of just writing everything in one place like we used to do in normal html.
